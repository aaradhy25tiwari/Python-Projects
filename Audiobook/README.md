# AudioBook - Turn your PDFs into Audio
## Requirements for this project are:
+ Python 3.10 and above
+ pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality: To install the module enter ``` pip install pyttsx3 ``` in the terminal <br> 

Pyttsx3 library is dependent on win32 for which we may get an error while executing the program. To avoid that simply install pypiwin32 in your environment.
``` pip install pypiwin32 ```
