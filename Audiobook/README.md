# AudioBook - Turn your PDFs into Audio
## Requirements for this project are:
+ Python 3.10 and above
+ pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality
+ pypdf library for PDF parsing

### Instructions
    Text to Speech Program using PyTTSX3 and pypdf
    ==============================================

    This program reads a PDF file and converts its text to speech using the PyTTSX3 library.

    Usage
    -----

    1. Replace `'Tutorial.pdf'` with the path to your PDF file.
    2. Make sure the PDF file is in the same directory as this script.
    3. Run the script.
    4. The program will read the PDF file and convert its text to speech.
    
## PyPDF Installation :
    pip install pypdf

## pyttsx3 Installation :

	pip install pyttsx3

> If you get installation errors , make sure you first upgrade your wheel version using :  
`pip install --upgrade wheel`
> Pyttsx3 library is dependent on win32 for which we may get an error while executing the program. To avoid that simply install pypiwin32 in your environment.
` pip install pypiwin32 `
> If you are using a virtual environment, make sure to install the library in the virtual environment.

## Usage :

```python3
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.say("I will speak this text")
engine.runAndWait()
```

**Single line usage with speak function with default options**

```python3
import pyttsx3
pyttsx3.speak("I will speak this text")
```
	
**Changing Voice , Rate and Volume :**

```python3
import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init() # object creation

""" RATE"""
rate = engine.getProperty('rate')   # getting details of current speaking rate
print (rate)                        #printing current voice rate
engine.setProperty('rate', 125)     # setting up new voice rate

"""VOLUME"""
volume = engine.getProperty('volume')   #getting to know current volume level (min=0 and max=1)
print (volume)                          #printing current volume level
engine.setProperty('volume',1.0)    # setting up volume level  between 0 and 1

"""VOICE"""
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')       #getting details of current voice
#engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  #changing index, changes voices. o for male
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)   #changing index, changes voices. 1 for female

engine.say("Hello World!")
engine.say('My current speaking rate is ' + str(rate))
engine.runAndWait()
engine.stop()

"""Saving Voice to a file"""
# On linux make sure that 'espeak' and 'ffmpeg' are installed
engine.save_to_file('Hello World', 'test.mp3')
engine.runAndWait()

```
