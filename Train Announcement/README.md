# Train Announcement system using Python tkinter and pyttsx3
## Requirements for this project are:
+ Python 3.10 and above
+ pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality
+ Tkinter library for GUI functionality

## pyttsx3 Installation :
	pip install pyttsx3

## tkinter Installation :
    pip install tk

> If you get installation errors, make sure you first upgrade your wheel version using :  
`pip install --upgrade wheel`
> Pyttsx3 library depends on win32 for which we may get an error while executing the program. To avoid that simply install pypiwin32 in your environment.
` pip install pypiwin32 `
> If you are using a virtual environment, make sure to install the library in the virtual environment.

## How to use it:

1. Run the program.
2. Fill in the form with the train details.
3. Click the "SUBMIT" button to hear the announcement.
